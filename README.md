# Hangman Re-Visited.... React-Visited?

This is a redesign / revisit of a game I wrote in jQuery, which was a redesign of a game I wrote in vanilla javaScript.  The original game used keyboard inputs, which doesn't operate well at all in a mobile format. I rewrote the game with a jQuery / bootstrap button keyboard. 

Original jQuery Game: https://github.com/CaptainJimmy/JQueryHangman

Original JS Game: https://github.com/CaptainJimmy/Hangman

This game is written entirely in React.

## Major Tech / Libraries Used:

* React
* Bootstrap-React
* Lodash
* Axios
* Npm
* Heroku

The game is currently deployed here: https://reacthangman.herokuapp.com/
